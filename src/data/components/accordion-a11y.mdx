### Differences from the [Accordion Component](/components/accordion)

- Added `aria` attributes
- Removed the smooth transition as it causes layout recalculations at each frame
- Updated to use `<section>` elements as they appear for screen readers that support navigation by landmarks
- Updated to use the `hidden` attribute to hide elements instead of `x-show`

_If there are more than 6 accordions on the page then use a `<div>` to avoid lots of region landmarks._
