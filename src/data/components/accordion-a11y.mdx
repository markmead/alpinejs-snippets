There's no smooth transition as it causes layout recalculations at each frame, therefore it becomes a [non-performant animation](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/high-performance-animations/) which is bad for accessibility.

We are making use of `<section>` as they are **region landmarks** which allows them to appear for screen readers that support navigation by landmarks. If there are more than 6 accordions on a page, then it's advised to use a `<div>` instead of a `<section>` to avoid a lot of region landmarks.
