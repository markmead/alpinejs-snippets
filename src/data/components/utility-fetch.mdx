title: Use Fetch
group: utility
---

This uses a plugin that adds Alpine JS magic methods `$get`, `$post`, `$put`, `$patch` and `$delete` as a wrapper for fetch.

It's a clone of [Alpine JS Axios](https://github.com/markmead/alpinejs-axios) but instead of using Axios, it uses the native JavaScript `fetch`.
