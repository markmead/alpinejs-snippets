title: How to create an accordion
group: Accordion

For this we use the official Alpine JS plugin [x-collapse](https://alpinejs.dev/plugins/collapse). However, you don't have to use this, it is possible to recreate the effect with the following:

- Add `maxHeight` value to `x-data`

```
x-data="{ activeAccordion: false, maxHeight: 0 }"
```

- Add an `x-init` on the same element as `x-data`

```
x-init="maxHeight = `${$refs.accordionContent.scrollHeight}px`"
```

- On each accordion content element add `x-ref="accordionContent"`
- On that same element add the styling

```
:style="activeAccordion && { 'max-height': maxHeight }"
```

And that's it, I can add an example if need be. However, here's the much cleaner approach using `x-collapse`.
