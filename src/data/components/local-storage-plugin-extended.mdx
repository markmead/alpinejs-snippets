This uses the official Alpine JS [$persist](https://alpinejs.dev/plugins/persist) plugin which has been extended through the community Alpine JS [$storage](https://github.com/markmead/alpinejs-persist-extended) plugin.

You can refresh the browser and Alpine JS will auto populate the `x-data` value from the local storage data.
