title: How to Create Tabs with URL Navigation
group: Tab
---

Creating tabs with URL navigation doesn't require much extra work over creating [standard tabs](/examples/tabs), all you need to add is a way for Alpine JS to read the hash in the URL and set the value.

```
x-init="activeTab = window.location.hash ? window.location.hash.replace('#', '') : 'details'"
```

Here we are checking if the URL has a hash, if so, we take that hash and remove the "#", if not, we default to "details".

As the preview is in an `<iframe>` you won't see the URL changing. However, if you head over to the [URL for the component HTML](/components/tabs-with-url.html) you will see it working.
