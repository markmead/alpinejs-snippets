Ever needed to get all the form data in an easy to read/use object? Well, it turns out you're not alone - [https://github.com/livewire/livewire/issues/313](https://github.com/livewire/livewire/issues/313).

Therefore, I took what Caleb posted as an approach and made it into a simple Alpine JS [$formData plugin](https://github.com/markmead/alpinejs-form-data) which is a magic method that returns the form data in an object.
